// 1. Home page ("/")
// 2. Products Page ("/products")

// ** Home Page **
// • Can be a basic home page, maybe welcoming the user to your site and giving some background about yourself as a developer

// ** Products Page **
// • Using an array of data for your products (provided for you), map over that data to show each item and some information on the products page as a list of available products.
