String Methods Exercise

Make a function that will return any given string into all caps followed by the same string all lowercase.

capitalizeAndLowercase("Hello") // => "HELLO hello"

Make a function that returns a number half the length, and rounded down. You'll need to use Math.floor().

findMiddleIndex("Hello") // => 2
findMiddleIndex("Hello World") // => 5

Make a function that uses slice() and the other functions you've written to return the first half of the string

returnFirstHalf("Hello") // => "He"
returnFirstHalf("Hello World") // => "Hello"

Make a function that takes a string and returns that string where the first half is capitalized, and the second half is lower cased.

hint: If the half way point is a decimal, or rather, your string length is odd. Use Math.floor to round down.

capitalizeAndLowercase("Hello") // => "HEllo"
capitalizeAndLowercase("Hello World") // => "HELLO world"
Optional Code Challenge (This one is a step up in difficulty and utilizes the .split() string method and .join() array method):

Make a function that takes any string and capitalizes any character that follows a space.

capitalize("hey friends! practice practice practice!") // -> "Hey Friends! Practice Practice Practice!"
