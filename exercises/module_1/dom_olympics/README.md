DOM Manipulation Olympics!
The Qualifier and Bronze Medal are required, the rest is an optional challenge

DOM manipulation is it's own beast. Fairly soon, you'll be doing a lot of it along side of other things that are conceptually difficult if you're not yet familiar with DOM manipulation.

This exercise is designed to help use repetition to become comfortable with syntax that is commonly used throughout the industry. Each step should be a stretch, but feel free to use what you learned from the last step to be able to complete the next.

Please take your time, and really understand why you're using the code you are using.
