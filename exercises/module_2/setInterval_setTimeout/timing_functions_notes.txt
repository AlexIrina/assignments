# JS Timing Functions
    
    # setInterval()
        Purpose: Call a function on a repeated basis. (ex: every 1 second)
        use it when you need something repeated
        it will give you the ID of the interval so you can clear it later
        need to pass 2 arguments in it
        1st arg: The function or what you want repeated
        2nd arg: Amount of time in milliseconds id like it to fire on.
        

    # setTimeout()
        Purpose: Call a function after a certain amount of time.
        
    
    * When used, both setInterval and setTimeout return and ID.  That ID can be given to clearInterval or clearTimeout to stop the timers.


    # clearInterval 
        Purpose: Clears the setInterval()
    
    # clearTimeout
        Purpose: Clears the setTimeout()
